<h1>Writings</h1>
<hr>
<p>In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to develop India into a "knowledge superpower" and a developed nation by 2020. He regarded his work on India's nuclear weapons programme as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.</p>
<p>I have identified five areas where India has a core competence for integrated action: (1) agriculture and food processing; (2) education and healthcare; (3) information and communication technology; (4) infrastructure, reliable and quality electric power, surface transport and infrastructure for all parts of the country; and (5) self-reliance in critical technologies. These five areas are closely inter-related and if advanced in a coordinated way, will lead to food, economic and national security.</p>
<p>Kalam describes a "transformative moment" in his life when he asked Pramukh Swami, the guru of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya, how India might realise this five-pronged vision of development.  Pramukh Swami's answer‚Äîto add a sixth area developing faith in God and spirituality to overcome the current climate of crime and corruption‚Äîbecame the spiritual vision for the next 15 years Kalam's life, which he describes in his final book, Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji, published just a month before his death.</p>   
<p>It was reported that there was considerable demand in South Korea for translated versions of books authored by him.[150]

    Kalam took an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology, including a research programme for developing biomedical implants. He also supported open source technology over proprietary software, predicting that the use of free software on a large scale would bring the benefits of information technology to more people.</p>

<p><b>Kalam's writings</b></p>
<p>The problem for the first-time author is figuring out how to get started. What are the writing habits you need to finish the actual writing for an entire book? And what comes next for your writing goals: traditional publishing? Self-publishing? Becoming a New York Times bestselling book? A long and illustrious writing career? </p>

  <p>  Because after coaching thousands of writers to write and finish their books, and also writing fifteen books of my own, I know exactly how much hard work it takes to finish a book.
    
    It's not enough to want to write, you need to know how to write a book.
    </p>
    <p>
    
    You need to have the right process. The write process, you might say (sorry, I had to!).
    
    In this guide, we're going to learn everything about how to write a nonfiction book, from how to defeat procrastination and find writing time, all the way to revising and the editing process‚Äîand even to the publishing process. </p>
    
   <p> If you've ever wanted to write a book, whether a memoir, a big idea book, or a self help book, you're in the right place.</p>
