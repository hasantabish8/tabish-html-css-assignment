                <p><b>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam </b>(born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India‚Äîdied July 27, 2015, Shillong) was an Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India‚Äôs missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.</p>
                <p>Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname ‚ÄúMissile Man.‚Äù Among those successes was Agni, India‚Äôs first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</p>
                <p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

                    While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.</p>
